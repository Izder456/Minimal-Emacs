<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I tried running Blockgame launcher, but it doesn&#39;t work on latest minecraft versions and when I compiled polymc from source (which was the one I was hoping to work the most) it ended up not working, due to some java PATH errors. Does anyone has any tips for either of those problems, or an entirely new solution? Thanks for any feedback.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ErnestNoga"> /u/ErnestNoga </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/13iij5v/whats_the_best_way_to_play_minecraft_on_openbsd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/13iij5v/whats_the_best_way_to_play_minecraft_on_openbsd/">[comments]</a></span>
