<p>As mentioned in my &quot;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cambus.net/customizing-netbsd-boot-banners/">Customizing NetBSD boot banners</a>&quot; article, it's
really easy to customize NetBSD boot banners using the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://man.netbsd.org/boot.cfg.5">boot.cfg</a>
configuration file.</p>
<p>In a previous life, I used to draw ASCII art (mostly in the pre-2000 era)
and more precisely a type of ASCII art referred as newschool ASCII in the
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_art_scene">artscene</a>. By taking advantage of the extended character set (the 128
to 255 range) of the IBM PC's <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ascii-codes.com">code page 437</a>, it was possible to achieve
great detail and really smooth curves. Some examples can be found at the
bottom of my <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://cleaner.ansilove.org/gallery.html">online gallery</a>.</p>
<p>Attempting to draw the NetBSD flag in ASCII and use it when booting in
both <strong>NetBSD/i386</strong> and <strong>NetBSD/amd64</strong> in BIOS mode was thus too
tempting, so here we go.</p>
<p>The NetBSD flag in full glory, loaded in TheDraw:</p>

<p>And here is a screenshot of the NetBSD x86 bootloader:</p>
<p><img src="/content/2023/01/netbsd-ascii-flag-bootloader.png" alt="NetBSD ASCII Flag in the bootloader" /></p>
<p>And this is how it could look like with colors and a customized VGA palette:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the extended ASCII characters do not display correctly
when booting in EFI mode, at least on the machine I tested on, but I
suspect it will likely be the case on other implementations as well.</p>
<p>As specified in the <strong>Human Interface Infrastructure</strong> part (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://uefi.org/specs/UEFI/2.10/33_Human_Interface_Infrastructure.html#limiting-glyphs">33.2.7.2</a>
subsection) of the <strong>UEFI</strong> specification, UEFI requires platform support
of a font containing the basic Latin character set. So extended ASCII
support is not mandatory, and there is no guarantee that the characters
would be the same between fonts used by different EFI firmwares anyway.</p>
<p>The <em>boot.cfg</em> configuration file can be downloaded <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cambus.net/files/netbsd/boot.cfg">here</a>. Enjoy!</p>
