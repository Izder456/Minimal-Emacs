<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Still trying to find a way to play some of my favorite childhood games on OpenBSD and found this Xbox emulator.</p> <p>Unfortunately, Google things I am googling qemu which is a totally different beast.</p> <p>I works on Windows and Linux. I can&#39;t seem to find anything about porting it to FreeBSD or OpenBSD.</p> <p>Just curious if anyone has ever tried porting it to OpenBSD or knew if it worked or anything?</p> <p>The game I most want to play most is Star Wars Battlefront 1 from 2004. It had PS2, Xbox, and PC versions.</p> <p>Unfortunately the PS2 needs PCSX2, the Xbox xemu, and the PC needs wine.</p> <p>All three of which are unavailable on OpenBSD.</p> <p>I mean no disrespect to the devs who work on porting games to OpenBSD, y&#39;all do a great job and my hat is off to you men and women!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/kyleW_ne"> /u/kyleW_ne </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/17yu96c/xemu_xbox_0_original_2003_version_work_on_openbsd/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/17yu96c/xemu_xbox_0_original_2003_version_work_on_openbsd/">[comments]</a></span>
