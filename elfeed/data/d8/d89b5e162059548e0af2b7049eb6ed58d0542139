<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know Terraria has gotten a lot of attention over time and had regular hiccups as in not working. With the update of goldberg_emulator to Steam SDK 1.57, I can confirm that Terraria runs, both with the <a href="https://GOG.com">GOG.com</a> and the Steam version <a href="https://1.4.4.9">1.4.4.9</a>. Note I&#39;ve run this with IndieRunner (<a href="https://github.com/IndieRunner/IndieRunner">https://github.com/IndieRunner/IndieRunner</a>) which will be the successor to fnaify, but isn&#39;t in ports yet.
