<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p><a href="https://izder456.neocities.org/ports">https://izder456.neocities.org/ports</a></p> <p>im so hyped for the release of openbsd 7.5 stable around april ish- given the 6 month release cycle.</p> <p>i mean- the fact that macppc has been confirmed to work with my ports of pangea software games on modern openbsd releases is peak druaga1 energy</p> <p>(just needs more ssds) ;)</p> <p>running the latest build of openbsd on hardware from three decades ago, just to run a modern port of that same game that was originally made for that same damn hardware…</p> <p>there’s some decadent irony there- and i love that i am mostly to blame for the time-unstuck pipe dream reality that is now.</p> <p>absolutely cursed and totally weird. exactly why i love open source. shit like that is not only possible- but an actual thing that actual people do.</p> <p>cheers to:</p> <ul> <li>the <code>ports@</code> mailing list for being helpful and patient with my “noobiness”. and especially <code>op@</code> for helping unintentionally by sorta giving a reference to the patches needed for the Data dir to function correctly via their <code>games/nanosaur2</code> port.</li> <li>upstream devs <a href="https://jorio.itch.io">Iliyas Jorio</a>, and ofc <a href="https://pangeasoft.net">pangea software</a></li> </ul> <p>this would not have been possible without them.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Izder456"> /u/Izder456 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/1av8fsy/pangea_soft_games_appreciation_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/1av8fsy/pangea_soft_games_appreciation_post/">[comments]</a></span>
