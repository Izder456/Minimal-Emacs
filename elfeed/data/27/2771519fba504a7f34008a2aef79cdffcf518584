<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello.</p> <p>I have noticed that I cannot really run Minecraft 1.16 or MineClone2 on OpenBSD.</p> <p>It all boils down to malloc. Trying to open a world in MineClone2 (Minetest-based) bails down to a malloc issue, that it could not allocate enough memory (the same was on NetBSD).</p> <p>Modern Minecraft needs at least 4gb of ram to run with decent performance, but I cannot allocate such. With the PolyMC launcher&#39;s javatest feature I was able to figure out, that the largest amount of memory I can allocate is about 1500 MB (maybe few MBs more, but 1600 cannot) (1.5 GB).</p> <p>If this was alone in only one of these, it must had been a Minetest/Java issue, but it accurs in both. It also happens on NetBSD.</p> <p>Why is that? How do I fix it?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/glowiak2"> /u/glowiak2 </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/15mi518/malloc_problems/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/15mi518/malloc_problems/">[comments]</a></span>
