<p>I got involved with <strong>Game Boy Advance</strong> development in 2001 shortly after the
release of the device on the European market.</p>
<p>At the time, the PC demoscene had already moved to producing those horrible
hardware-accelerated 3D demos and it was time for me to move on.
In my eyes, the GBA scene provided a refuge for the 2D and bitmapped graphics
lovers, and so I spent some time playing with the device.</p>
<p>The scene was very active and the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.gbadev.org">gbadev.org</a> site provided a lot of
resources for homebrew developers. At the same time, the release groups
were not in rest, providing a continuous supply of lovely cracktros and
trainers. Some demoscene productions were also released on this platform,
and I fondly remember <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://demozoo.org/productions/67816/">Gameboy Advance 3D-Trip</a> by Oxygene, and
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://demozoo.org/productions/119504/">Kance</a> by Condense.</p>
<p>During this period, I acquired a pre-owned <strong>Flash Advance Linker</strong>, a device
manufactured by Visoly in 2001. Because the previous owner was also selling
his GBA, I ended up owning two of them. As my plan back then was to pursue
the idea of developing a multiplayer puzzle game, on the hardware side at
least, I had everything I ever needed.</p>
<p>Life happened though, things didn't exactly go as planned and I had to sell
the two GBAs temporarily, or so I thought. I kept the linker though, and
when I acquired the HP t5570e and HP t510 thin clients back in 2017, it
meant that I finally had some devices with a parallel port again.</p>
<p>Here is the device in full glory:</p>

<p>And here is the PCB:</p>

<p>I'm happy to announce that after 20 years, the linker is still working!
Back in the days, I was using <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ucon64.sourceforge.io/">uCON64</a> to transfer data to the flash cart.
Not only is it still being maintained, but it still has releases for DOS,
so I went this route to bring things back to life.</p>
<p>uCON64 uses <strong>LPT1</strong> by default when using the Flash Advance Linker, so we
can simply send and receive ROMs to/from the flash cart with the <em>-xfal</em>
option. As it outputs ANSI escape sequences for displaying its progress bar,
we need to have an ANSI driver running, either <strong>ANSI.SYS</strong> on MS-DOS or
<strong>NANSI.SYS</strong> on FreeDOS.</p>

<p>The cartridge still works flawlessly and I was able to run some demos
again on the <strong>Revo K101</strong> a friend donated a couple years ago. This sure
brings back memories...</p>
<p>Lastly, here is an old <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.wired.com/2001/12/flash-advance-linker-and-card/">article</a> from Wired about this wonderful little
device.</p>
