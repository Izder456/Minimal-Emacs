<!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am excited to announce the 1.0 release of rigg! With this program, a large number of games based on Mono or HashLink can be run on OpenBSD. It uses unveil(2) for 2 purposes: In <em>strict</em> mode (the default), filesystem access/visibility is reduced to the empirical minimum necessary, protecting other parts of the file system from inadvertent or malicious access. The other use of unveil(2) is to hide bundled libraries of the Linux game version, so that the engine can fall back on the OpenBSD-native libraries.</p> <p>Some notable games that have been tested with rigg(1) on OpenBSD (make sure pertinent libraries are installed to run them):</p> <ul> <li>Crystal Project</li> <li>Dead Cells</li> <li>Hacknet</li> <li>Northgard</li> <li>Nuclear Blaze</li> <li>Opus Magnum</li> <li>Owlboy</li> <li>Salt and Sanctuary</li> <li>SpaceChem</li> <li>Terraria</li> </ul> <p>Many thanks to <a href="https://github.com/brynet">@brynet</a> whose work on <a href="https://github.com/brynet/unveilro">unveilro(1)</a> has been a significant inspiration for rigg!</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/rfht/rigg/releases/tag/1.0">rigg 1.0</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxyzz07LFGpX71d-Fc03gqoHZ8_ch5uIDG">demonstration of rigg&#39;s use of unveil</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/thfrw"> /u/thfrw </a> <br/> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/1bb9wle/rigg_10_released_a_new_way_to_run_indie_games_on/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/openbsd_gaming/comments/1bb9wle/rigg_10_released_a_new_way_to_run_indie_games_on/">[comments]</a></span>
