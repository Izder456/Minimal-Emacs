<p>Back in the fall of 2020, I was approached about adding <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fcambus/spleen">Spleen</a> to
the NetBSD's <strong>xsrc</strong> repository. Needless to say, I wasn't difficult to
convince, and imported Spleen 1.8.2 as <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.freshbsd.org/netbsd/xsrc/commit/ltINGQFMDlVR4drC">font-spleen-misc</a>. With this
being done, nia@ added all the required glue to hook the fonts to the
build, and then changed the default CTWM configuration to do <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.freshbsd.org/netbsd/src/commit/KkU41ZuoYV9FvBrC">automatic
font scaling based on screen size</a>, and make Spleen the default font.</p>
<p>CTWM had previously been promoted as the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://blog.netbsd.org/tnf/entry/default_window_manager_switched_to">default window manager</a> on
NetBSD, and saw several tweaks and improvements to make it look more
modern, notably with a nice orange themed menu.</p>
<p>Below is a screenshot of CTWM with <strong>Spleen 8x16</strong>, running on my <strong>HP
t510</strong> Thin Client plugged to a 1600x900 monitor, showing <strong>JED</strong>,
<strong>Lynx</strong>, <strong>xcalc</strong> and <strong>xv</strong>.</p>

<p>One last thing to note, there are now live images available in <strong>-current</strong>
for amd64, and NetBSD 10 will be the first release to officially provide
them. While <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/evbarm/">NetBSD/evbarm</a> has had live images for a long time now,
their availability on amd64 is a much welcome addition, as this allows to
easily test NetBSD's default CTWM configuration :-)</p>
<p>The most recent version is currently <strong>NetBSD-9.99.90-amd64-live.img.gz</strong>
and can be downloaded <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://nycdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD-daily/HEAD/latest/images/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once again, thanks to Nia for doing all of this!</p>
