<p>Back in 2016, I sent a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&amp;m=147535923705402&amp;w=2">diff</a> to OpenBSD's tech@ mailing list which
added missing airports and area codes for Poland. Theo kindly pointed
out privately that there was a rule governing the update of this file,
which was known among OpenBSD developers but never made it into a commit.
So I ended up making <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/8qKRlaACyhZSrcEa">one</a> adding my home airport (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rzesz%C3%B3w%E2%80%93Jasionka_Airport">RZE</a>) to the
list and specifying update rules: only add ones you have been to.
Later on, I also added the code for the Warsaw Modlin airport (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw_Modlin_Airport">WMI</a>),
from which I did a couple of round trips that same year.</p>
<p>At the OpenBSD <strong>d2k17</strong> hackathon, the rules were documented in a newly
introduced <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://man.openbsd.org/airport.7">airport(7)</a> manual page: &quot;New airports can only be added
by OpenBSD developers who have visited an airport and thereby have verified
its existence&quot;. Once again, the more astute reader will not have missed
the fact that the rules do not stipulate any flying requirements. Neither
did henning@, who not long after <em>airport.7</em> was committed, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/ztW1pPgN6oa712AF">added
an entry for XFW</a>, (the Airbus factory) which he had visited but not
flown from.</p>
<p>Today, I finally took some time off and did a day trip to Lublin.
No trip to a city is complete without a visit to its airport, right?</p>

<p>One can say anything about Lublin airport, but they sure do consider
<strong>IATA</strong> codes are serious business. The tone was set right from the
parking lot entrance.</p>

<p>And with this, I'm happy to announce that there is a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/openbsd/src/commit/xZeFvUEDeAp8INp3">new entry</a> for
<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lublin_Airport">LUZ</a> in the <em>airport</em> file! You are welcome.</p>
