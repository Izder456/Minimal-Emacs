<p>In the introduction of my &quot;<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.cambus.net/why-openbsd/">Why OpenBSD?</a>&quot; post, I mentioned that I came
to the BSD world through FreeBSD.</p>
<p>Rather than paraphrasing what I wrote back then, here is the relevant part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve been using FreeBSD from 2000 to 2005 as my sole operating system at
the time (both on servers and workstations), from 4.1 to the end of the 4.x
series. I have fond memories of that period, and that’s probably the main
reason why I’ve been diving again into the BSDs during the last few years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I started using FreeBSD in September 2000 coming from Slackware Linux,
not knowing it would be the beginning of a more than 20-year journey.</p>
<p>At the time, I still didn't have broadband internet access so downloading
ISOs over a dial-up connection was not an option. I'm not exactly sure how
I got the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.freebsd.org/releases/4.1R/announce/">FreeBSD 4.1</a> installation CD from, but I think I might have
ordered it from <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20001109120500/http://ikarios.com/form/#bsd">Ikarios</a>, a French distributor of Linux and BSD
distribution CDs.</p>
<p>Having spent a large part of the nineties immersed in text mode on MS-DOS,
mostly because of my involvement in the BBS and ANSI art scenes, it's
only natural that I kept the habit of using text consoles on Linux.
On the hardware I was using at the time, I was often hitting a random issue
causing the machine to become unusable when switching between text consoles
and the X server.</p>
<p>Switching back and forth between X and text consoles was such an important
use case for me at the time, that I was willing to try everything in order
to fix the problem. Luckily, FreeBSD didn't exhibit the issue, and as an
added benefit, the FreeBSD console could display ANSI art with <em>cat(1)</em>
in full glory out of the box. One could connect to telnet BBSes using the
system telnet client, and enjoy an MS-DOS like experience.</p>
<p>FreeBSD provided many other benefits, but most importantly a clean and
well integrated system. The quality of the documentation made things a lot
easier than in the Linux world. Configuring IPFW was a breeze compared to
what was available on Linux at the time. Being able to tweak and compile
kernels using a single text configuration file was also a powerful thing,
and I remember spending an unhealthy amount of time compiling the smallest
possible working kernels in order to save RAM and compile time.</p>
<p>FreeBSD also offered a great platform for C development, with quality manual
pages documenting the C library.</p>
<p>It thus won't come as a surprise that I learned a lot about UNIX systems
during that period. I also started contributing to the ports collection
(<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/ports/commit/baf57e3382b63a31656f1de6844afaba5be1c014">babytrans</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/ports/commit/302c3bd32990a4006a52370149d091a1dfa26308">dtc</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/ports/commit/2c1676782f3825a08496b1a302f861ddfd2c28cf">gsfv</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/ports/commit/486a5d36cb11f558f319fe3d5f07a54a2f214922">huc</a>, <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://freshbsd.org/freebsd/ports/commit/479a0785ef1500e7ffe454b4e6a7d39761c58ebf">multimail</a>,

driven social news site for the releases of FreeBSD <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://linuxfr.org/news/sortie-de-freebsd-411">4.11</a> and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://linuxfr.org/news/sortie-de-freebsd-60--2">6.0</a>.</p>
<p>Ultimately by 2005 software was getting larger, especially browsers so
compiling ports was not practical anymore and binary packages were still a
bit of a hit and miss on FreeBSD at this time. The FreeBSD 5.x series was
unfortunately plagued by unreliability issues, which prompted me to go explore
other shores.
My BSD story was to be continued a few years later anyway, little did I know
at the time...</p>
