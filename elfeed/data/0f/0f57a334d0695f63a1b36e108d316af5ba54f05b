<p><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fcambus/spleen">Spleen</a> 2.0.0 has been released, with full support for <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ascii-codes.com">CP437 (IBM PC)</a>
encoding in the 8x16, 16x32, and 32x64 versions.</p>
<p>It required a large effort and represents 135 commits since Spleen 1.9.3
which resulted in almost 90 new characters in the previously mentioned sizes.</p>
<p>A lot has happened since the 1.0.0 release back in September 2018:</p>
<ul>
<li>It became the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20190110064857">default font for OpenBSD consoles</a> in January 2019</li>
<li>It was imported in the NetBSD src tree in March 2019</li>
<li>It was included in the FreeBSD base system in May 2023</li>
</ul>
<p>Spleen's README now has a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fcambus/spleen#trivia">trivia</a> section listing all the operating
systems and programs where the fonts have been embedded or bundled in.</p>
<p>But let's go back to the newly announced release and focus on the recently
introduced changes.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the CP437 version of 16x32:</p>

<p>This is an important milestone as it allows nice things like having a DOS
version of Spleen. It is implemented as a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fcambus/spleen/blob/master/dos/spleen.com">COM file</a> changing the font
to Spleen 8x16, and has been tested both in DOSBox and on FreeDOS.</p>
<p>Here is &quot;L'Ã‰tranger&quot; from Baudelaire using Spleen on an ASUS Eee PC running FreeDOS:</p>

<p>On top on that, Spleen is now also available in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ansilove/libansilove">libansilove</a> since version
1.4.0 and in <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.ansilove.org/">Ansilove</a> since version 4.2.0, making it possible to render
ANSI art using a modern font.</p>
<p>And with this out of the way, I can now start working on the next Spleen
milestone, which I hope to be able to announce in a not so distant future...
Stay tuned!</p>
